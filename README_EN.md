### Introduction

Flutter list item sliding menu component, flutter_slidable_list_view [github] (https://github.com/tsx1453/flutter_slidable_list_view), [pub] (https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_slidable_list_view) optimized and refactored version
Part of the implementation borrowed from [Provider] (https://pub.dev/packages/provider). Because the previous stable_list_view was too sloppy, it also added a flutter header. Now it is no longer visible, so I revisit this In the project ~~ Refactoring ~~ (Rewrite), if there are any problems, please point out the issues, and I will deal with them in time (flag.png)


The number of menu Actions and widgets of each Item can be customized freely. Compared to the previous flutter_slidable_list_view, it is no longer bound to ListView, and at the same time, it optimizes performance. Previously, sliding all elements of an entire list to rebuild, now only a very small part will be reconstructed At present, the refresh range has been controlled to a minimum. If there is room for optimization in the future, it will continue to be optimized.

### how to use

Based on the original ListView, the outer layer uses `SlideConfiguration` to wrap the relevant configuration information of the sliding menu, and then
The original item can be wrapped with `SlideItem`. For the usage method, please refer to the code of the sample program. The meaning of the parameters of the involved classes will be explained below.

#### note
Because InheritedWidget is used, this package development environment uses flutter -v1.12 version, which has been obtained using the latest methods such as `dependOnInheritedWidgetOfExactType`
InheritedWidget, if you need to use the old version, you can use the version with the suffix -adapt
